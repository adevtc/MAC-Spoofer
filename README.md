# MAC-Spoofer
MAC Address Spoofer

This python script allows user to randomly generate a 16-digit hexadecimal 
which is used to spoof their MAC-Address. This script is only for MacOS 
users and I'll make one eventually to work with Windows 10 systems.

Capabilities:

- Generate Custom MAC Address
- Custom MAC Address
- Reset MAC Address (broken right now)
- Time-Specified MAC Address changing (broken right now)


Also, the text and other feautures are buggy
