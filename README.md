# MAC-Spoofer
MAC Address Spoofer

This python script allows user to randomly generate a 16-digit hexadecimal 
which is used to spoof their MAC-Address. This script is only for MacOS 
users and I'll make one eventually to work with Windows 10 systems.

**UPDATES**
    - I've fixed some basic bugs (colors, and MAC Address resetting)
    - I've also cleaned up the look and made it easier for work-flow
    - This will be the latest update until I release more of this script so it's compatible for Windows 10 Users
    - I will be making a blog-post about this application on my website --> https://www.jaunty.dev (in projects)
    
Capabilities:

- Generate Custom MAC Address
