# MAC-Spoofer
MAC Address Spoofer

This python script allows user to randomly generate a 16-digit hexadecimal 
which is used to spoof their MAC-Address. This script is only for MacOS 
users and I'll make one eventually to work with Windows 10 systems.

Capabilities:

- Generate Custom MAC Address
- Custom MAC Address
- Reset MAC Address **FIXED**

    1. Download mac-changer.py file
    2. Open up terminal window
    3. Make sure python is installed
    4. Type 'python3 ' then drag the mac-changer.py file into the terminal window
    5. Press enter
